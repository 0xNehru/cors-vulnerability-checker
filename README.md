__CORS Vulnerability Checker__

__Description__

This Python script checks for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) vulnerability in a list of URLs by sending OPTIONS requests with a specified origin header. It then prints the result for each URL, indicating whether CORS is enabled and the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header value.

**Requirements**

> Python 3.x

> Requests library (pip install requests)

**Clone the repository:**

1. git clone https://github.com/0xNehru/cors-vulnerability-checker.git
   
__Navigate to the project directory:__

2. cd cors-vulnerability-checker

Create a text file containing a list of URLs to check, with one URL per line. Save this file as **urls.txt**.

__Run the script using Python:__

python cors_checker.py -l urls.txt

Replace **urls.txt** with the actual filename if you named the file differently.

**Example**

Suppose you have a file urls.txt containing the following URLs:

https://example.com/endpoint1

https://example.com/endpoint2

https://example.com/endpoint3

Running the script will produce __output__ like this:

https://example.com/endpoint1: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello.com

https://example.com/endpoint2: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello.com

https://example.com/endpoint3: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello.com
