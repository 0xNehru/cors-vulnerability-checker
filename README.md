__CORS Vulnerability Checker__

__Description__

This Python script checks for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) vulnerability in a list of URLs by sending OPTIONS requests with a specified origin header. It then prints the result for each URL, indicating whether CORS is enabled and the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header value.

**Requirements**

> Python 3.x

> Requests library (pip install requests)

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cors-vulnerability-checker.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd cors-vulnerability-checker
Create a text file containing a list of URLs to check, with one URL per line. Save this file as urls.txt.

Run the script using Python:

Copy code
python cors_checker.py -l urls.txt
Replace urls.txt with the actual filename if you named the file differently.

Example
Suppose you have a file urls.txt containing the following URLs:

arduino
Copy code
https://example.com/endpoint1
https://example.com/endpoint2
https://example.com/endpoint3
Running the script will produce output like this:

bash
Copy code
https://example.com/endpoint1: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello.com
https://example.com/endpoint2: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello.com
https://example.com/endpoint3: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello.com
